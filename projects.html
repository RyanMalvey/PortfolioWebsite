                <p><p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Project Summary:</p1><br><br>An efoil, also known as electric hydrofoil, is a battery powered motorized surfboard, riding on a hydrofoil. I built an efoil as my senior capstone project for high school, with the help of my two mentors, Justin Crank and Chris Balck. My official assignment was to spend the semester working on a large project using the engineering design process, whilst documenting the process.

                    To start the project, I put together a gantt chart to ensure I would complete the project before reaching the deadline. I planned out every major portion of the project, including making a bill of materials, making a CAD model of the board, cutting the board with a CNC router, assembling the electronics, and assembling the final design.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I had the project planned out, I put together a bill of materials, ensuring all of the components I found were compatible and reliable. I also constructed a CAD model of the board, which I would be creating by cutting the form out of foam with a CNC router and then fiberglassing the board to add rigidity, strength, and make waterproof.
                    <br><br>
                    After cutting the foam, I constructed the board using fiberglass and epoxy, as well as two square aluminum tubes down the base of the board to add a mounting point for the foil. While I waited for the layers of epoxy to dry, I started putting together the electronics. This part of the project involved soldering connectors for the battery onto the esc, soldering the esc to the motor, and adding a breaker in the event of a short circuit.
                    <br><br>
                    I put the electronics in a waterproof box and strapped it to the board. I bolted the hydrofoil to the aluminum tubes running down the underside of the board. Finally, I put the board in the water and ran a test. The project functioned, but it wasn’t fast enough to take advantage of the foil. I believe this issue can be fixed, but in the meantime the project will still function as an aquatic vehicle until I can find the solution.
                    <br><br><br><p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Project Analysis:</p1><br><br>This project is by far the largest project I have ever attempted. It forced me to manage my time extremely well to ensure I never fell behind. Throughout the project, I had to document my work and present weekly updates on how the project is progressing.
                    <br><br>
                    This project forced me to learn a variety of new skills, as well as revisit old ones. To make the CAD model of the board, I had to learn to use Fusion 360, since solidworks didn’t have an easy solution for file sharing. I needed to learn to use a drill press to put holes in both aluminum and wood. I learned how to cut large objects using a CNC router, and consequently ended up teaching a few of my classmates to use the machine as well. I learned how to use fiberglass and epoxy to strengthen a structure, and I used a dremel and orbital sanding machine to smooth the board. In addition to the new skills, the project helped me refine my soldering ability. I also had to improve my researching skills to ensure that all the parts I found online were safe and could be used with each other.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was extremely successful because it forced me to put together a bunch of skills that I had previously only used separately for small projects. For example, using a 3D modeling software, soldering, and using fiberglass are three things that I’d never used in the same project until now. Additionally, I learned how effective time management is vital for a large project like this one.

            <div class="tab-contents" id="drone">
                <p><p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Project Summary:</p1><br><br>This project came about after I saw a clip from DRL, also known as the Drone Racing League on television. I thought the drone that they race were really interesting, so I set out to build my own. To start the project, I did a lot of research about what a drone is and how one is built. I found that the type of drone I was after is called an FPV (first person view) drone. They have an onboard camera so the pilot can see any obstacles in the way of the drone without actually being in direct line of sight.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I knew what kind of drone I wanted to make, I started looking for parts. I found I would need a transmitter, a flight controller, a frame, an esc, four motors, a power distribution board, and a headset, along with a few other small parts.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I knew what I needed, I found some cheap parts online and purchased them. The most difficult part of the build was soldering the components together, and I when I finished it didn’t function. I ended up taking a risk and replacing one part that looked like it might be causing the issue, and it paid off. The drone flies and actively transmits video to the pilot.
                    <br><br><br><p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Project Analysis:</p1><br><br>This project was very enjoyable because it was the first time I actually built something by ordering components online and assembling them. This was different from other projects that simply included a kit and instructions because I actually had todo research on my own to ensure all the parts I was using were compatible, and that nothing would burn out or short circuit. I was especially satisfied with how the build went, not because everything wen smoothly, but because when something went wrong I was always able to find the source of the problem so I could find a solution.
                    <br><br>
                    This was one of my first projects where I had to learn a new skill. I had to figure out how to solder, both wire to wire connections, and wire to circuit board connections. I started out watching a bunch of youtube videos, and then practiced on wire, but for the circuit boards I had no option but to jump off the deep end and start soldering with circuit boards on the actual thing. Building the drone myself helped open up an entirely new area of circuitry that had previously been foreign to me.
                    <br><br>
                    The project opened up many new opportunities since I now knew how to solder, and more importantly how to research and find information online. This project directly led to me eventually starting to build an efoil, a project that required months more research and planning, as well as my soldering skills and skills I had not yet developed.

                <p><p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Project Summary:</p1><br><br>This was a project I worked on with a team, for a challenge called First Lego League in 2013/2014. The challenge involved designing something that would combat a natural disaster. Our team chose wildfires because some of our team members had a cabin in an area that often had wildfires. Our team consisted of six 5th and 6th graders (myself included) and three mentors. Liam Flanary, Samuel Kalkman, Ryan Malvey, Sam Ruzynski, Nick Ruzynski, and Evan Sougstad were the six team members. Megan Malvey, Mindy Ruzynski, and Steve Wolgamot were the three mentors.
                    <br><br>
                    To start the project, our team found that houses often burn down in wildfires because the heat of the fire shatters the window of the house, and then embers light the flammable interior. To combat this, our team decided to make a device that shuts over the windows of a house in the event of a fire to prevent the house from burning down.
                    <br><br>
                    We started by testing insulation by putting different materials on a burner and a thermometer on the other side. The material that let through the least heat was cement board, but the problem was cement board is brittle, and could easily break into pieces. To combat this, we used a layer of plywood to add support to the cement board, on the side facing the house so the wood wouldn’t catch fire.
                    <br><br>
                    The final step was deciding how we could close the shutter on the house. Since we wanted a solution that was relatively cheap, I suggested we use gravity to act as the force that closes the shutter, as opposed to a motor. Combining this with a latch and birthday candle as the trigger, the device was cheap to make and reset, and would trigger whenever the temperature rose enough to melt the candle.
                    <br><br><br><p1 style="font-size: 30px;">Project Analysis:</p1><br><br>This was probably the first real engineering project I took part in, and it went extraordinarily well. As a team, we learned to think critically to solve problems. We also learned to work with each other to find a solution instead of everyone trying to make their own solution, which was a miracle for a group of 5th graders.
                    <br><br>
                    The project itself went well, but it didn’t stop when we finished the design. With the help of my grandfather, Steve Wolgamot, the team decided to pursue a patent. The first step was finding legal representation, a difficult task for a group who was broke. Eventually we were lead to a company called LegalCorps, a company that offers free legal consultation to nonprofit organizations. We then went to the nonprofit known as MAEF (Mahtomedi Area Education Foundation) to get access to lawyers from LegalCorps.
                    <br><br>
                    With their help, we eventually submitted our own patent application. This application would be reviewed to determine whether or not the invention is original. The first submission was declined, which is very common, and LegalCorps gave advice on how to improve the application. Our second application was also declined, but after one more revision, on our third submission, nearly three years after starting the project, the patent was granted.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was extremely eye opening for our group of six aspiring inventors who got to see up front the entire process for applying for and obtaining a patent. We got to see just how rigorous the process is, and how much work is really needed to do well in the field. Additionally, we were interviewed by our local paper, an article that can be read at <a href="https://www.presspubs.com/white_bear/news/young-inventors-awarded-patent/article_4261efe0-3e10-11e6-851c-77fdd57f02df.html">this link</a>. It was an experience that, to this day, impacts how I view engineering, and the decisions I make to succeed.
